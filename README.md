# VEX Robotics SDSMT

This repo contains code for the VEX robotics team for the last 5 years of competition.

# Overview

This season, we are playing a game called Tipping Point. Each team has 2 robots and 2 minutes to compete against each other to get a better score. Our club is split into a build team and a programming team, both equally necessary to do well in competition. This github outlines the work and progress of those on the programming team and contains the code that we will be using on the robots this year.
